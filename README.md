## Introduction

Terra-Logger is a tool that simplifies the process of organizing and managing data from Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator. With Terra-Logger, you can take an exported map file from Azgaar's generator and automatically generate organized individual Markdown files for each city, country, religious details, and more. This makes it easier to document and present your world-building project in a structured and easily readable format.
**Please note: This is a one-way process, and any changes made to exported files will not sync to your map.**

## Features

- Convert Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator map files into individual Markdown files for each city, country, and religious detail.
- Automatically organize the information for cities, countries, religious details, and more.
- Display all available information for easy review before exporting files.

## Usage

To use Terra-Logger, follow these steps:

1. Visit Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator and save your .map file.
2. Import Your .map file into Terra-Logger under the settings page.
3. View your data.
4. Export the organized Markdown files.
